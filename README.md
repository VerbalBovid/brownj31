## Bacon Marmalade Burgers

<img src="bacon_marmalade_burgers/burgers.jpeg" width="300" />

### Ingredients

- $2$ lbs ground beef, portioned into $8$ burgers and seasoned with salt
  and pepper
- $1$ lb thick cut bacon
- $1$ sweet onion, slivered
- $\frac{1}{2}$ cup brown sugar
- $8$ sesame seed buns
- $1$ pkg [Alouette cheese
  spread](https://www.kroger.com/p/alouette-garlic-herb-soft-spreadable-cheese/0007144830014?fulfillment=PICKUP&storecode=01600621&&cid=shp_adw_shopl_.FY23.01_search_ent_conv_lia_corelia_kroger_g_lia_shop_acq_evgn_ship_all_roas_deli&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6rCgBhDVARIsAK1kGPJxmr-45Ox-J_PqG65vHUoXBX-TFPwEPjpnpYg4Po-GhQAFiM1vPgoaAnAeEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

### Directions

1.  Cut bacon into small pieces and cook in a skillet over medium-high
    heat until crispy (about $8$ minutes).
2.  Remove bacon from skillet, but leave $2$ tbsp of bacon grease in the
    pan to cook the onions. Add slivered onions to the same skillet and
    cook for $8$ minutes.
3.  Reduce the heat to low so the onions can caramelize. Add
    $\frac{1}{2}$ cup brown sugar and continue to cook them until they
    completely caramelize (about $20$ minutes).
4.  Add the bacon bits back into the caramelized onions.
5.  Smash each burger portion very thin (I use the underside of a pan)
    and cook for about $1\frac{1}{2}$ minutes per side.
6.  Serve by putting a burger on a toasted bun and adding bacon
    marmalade and alouette cheese spread.

### Ingredients

### Directions

## Cinnamon Rolls

<img src="cinnamon_rolls/cinnamon_rolls.jpeg" width="300" />

### Ingredients

##### Dough

- $1$ loaf frozen [bread
  dough](https://rhodesbakenserv.com/white-bread-2/), thawed

##### Filling

- $\frac{1}{2}$ cup light brown sugar
- $\frac{1}{4}$ cup white sugar
- $6$ tbsp butter
- $2$ tbsp cinnamon

##### Cream Cheese Icing

- $2$ oz Philadelphia cream cheese
- $3$ tbsp butter
- $3$ cups confectioners sugar (AKA powdered sugar)
- $6$ tbsp milk
- $\frac{3}{4}$ tsp vanilla extract

**Note**: This makes **a lot** of cream cheese icing.

##### Glaze Icing

- $2$ cups confectioners sugar (AKA powdered sugar)
- $4$ tbsp melted butter
- $1$ tsp vanilla extract
- $3-6$ tbsp hot water

### Directions

1.  Thaw bread dough in refrigerator overnight (per instructions on
    package). Take it out of the refrigerator about an hour before using
    it so that it isn’t stiff.
2.  Roll dough into a flat rectangle.
3.  Combine filling ingredients in a large bowl, and spread evenly onto
    the flattened dough.
4.  Roll dough into a a cylinder and cut into $1$” pieces. I like to do
    this by repeatedly cutting the pieces in half until they are about
    the right size.
5.  Bake at $350^\circ F$ for $25$ minutes.
6.  Immediately after coming out of the oven, cover with icing of choice
    from above.

## Crunchwraps

<img src="crunchwraps/crunchwraps.jpeg" width="300" />

### Ingredients

**Note**: The ingredients can vary. This recipe has the ingredients I’ve
used most often.

- $1$ lb ground beef
- $1$ package taco seasoning (I like Taco Bell brand)
- $12$” flour tortillas
- shredded cheese
- canned nacho cheese
- tostadas
- sour cream
- diced tomatoes (I like to use Roma, since they’re cheapest per pound)
- taco sauce

### Directions

1.  Cook ground beef in a skillet over medium heat. Add taco seasoning
    at the end (per packet instructions).
2.  Heat nacho cheese ina small saucepan.
3.  Place ground beef in the ceter of a warmed tortilla (I microwave the
    tortillas for $30$ seconds to make them less likely to break).
4.  Add nacho cheese, taco sauce, sour cream, tomatoes then top with a
    tostada shell. Add shredded cheese. **It is important that the
    shredded cheese is the last thing added, since it will be the glue
    that holds the crunchwrap together.**
5.  Fold the edges of the tortilla up around the tostada and shredded
    cheese.
6.  Cook the crunchwrap seam-side down for $3$ minutes. Then flip and
    cook an additional $1$ minute.

## Doughnuts

<img src="doughnuts/doughnuts.jpeg" width="300" />

### Ingredients

##### Dough

- $1$ loaf frozen [bread
  dough](https://rhodesbakenserv.com/white-bread-2/), thawed
- cinnamon sugar

##### Glaze

- $2$ cups confectioners sugar (AKA powdered sugar)
- $4$ tbsp melted butter
- $1$ tsp vanilla extract
- $3-6$ tbsp hot water

### Directions

1.  Thaw bread dough in refrigerator overnight (per instructions on
    package). Take it out of the refrigerator about an hour before using
    it so that it isn’t stiff.
2.  Roll dough into a flat rectangle. Using a drinking glass, cut
    circles out of dough. Using the cap of a plastic disposable water
    bottle, cut out small holes in the middle of each doughnut.
3.  Roll scraps into a new flat rectangle and cut out more doughnuts
    until there is no dough left.
4.  Fill a pot with about $2$ inches of vegetable oil and heat to
    $350^\circ F$. **If the oil is too hot, the doughnuts will burn.**
    Cook doughnuts for $1-2$ minutes per side, until golden brown. Cook
    in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot.
5.  Immediately after removing the doughnuts from the oil, dip in glaze,
    and add additional toppings of choice. I like to coat with cinnamon
    sugar.

**Note**: I normally double the yum yum sauce recipe.

- $1 \frac{1}{4}$ cups mayonnaise
- $\frac{1}{4}$ cup water
- $1$ tbsp melted butter
- $1$ tsp tomato paste
- $1$ tsp white sugar
- $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp garlic powder
- $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp paprika
- $1$ pinch cayenne pepper

#### Fried Rice

- $1$ cup rice

### Directions

## Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies

<img src="oatmeal_chocolate_chip_cookie/cookie.jpeg" width="300" />

### Ingredients

- $\frac{1}{2}$ lb unsalted butter (2 sticks)
- $\frac{3}{4}$ cup + 1 tbsp white sugar
- $\frac{3}{4}$ cup light brown sugar
- $2$ eggs
- $1\frac{1}{4}$ tsp vanilla extract
- $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp lemon juice
- $2\frac{1}{4}$ cup flour
- $\frac{1}{2}$ cup rolled oats (or use flour if you don’t have oats)
- $1$ tsp baking soda
- $1$ tsp salt
- $1$ pinch cinnamon
- $2\frac{2}{3}$ cups Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate chips
- $1\frac{3}{4}$ cups chopped walnuts

**Note**: I normally skimp on the chocolate chips and walnuts

### Directions

1.  Cream $\frac{1}{2}$ lb unsalted butter (2 sticks), $\frac{3}{4}$
    cup + 1 tbsp white sugar, and $\frac{3}{4}$ cup light brown sugar
    until thoroughly combined. If you don’t have an electric mixer, it’s
    easiest to do this by cutting the butter into small cubes and using
    a wooden spoon to work it into the sugar.
2.  Add $2$ eggs, $1\frac{1}{4}$ tsp vanilla extract, and $\frac{1}{4}$
    tsp lemon juice and mix until light and fluffy.
3.  Add $2\frac{1}{4}$ cup flour, $\frac{1}{2}$ cup rolled oats, $1$ tsp
    baking soda, $1$ tsp salt, and $1$ pinch cinnamon and stir to
    combine.
4.  Stir in $2\frac{2}{3}$ cups Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate
    chips and $1\frac{3}{4}$ cups chopped walnuts.
5.  Portion dough with an ice cream scoop (about $3$ tbsp) and roll into
    tall cylinders. To make the dough less sticky, it is helpful to
    refrigerate it for $30$ minutes prior to portioning.
6.  Let portioned dough freeze overnight.
7.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. **Do NOT use cooking
    spray. It will make the dough flatten too much.**
8.  Bake at $300^\circ F$ for $22$ minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes to
    allow cookies to set.

  Get the smallest can you can find. I normally get 15 oz, and that is
  too much for $1$ pizza.

- $8$ oz pepperoni. I like to buy a stick and cut the pepperonis thick.
  That way they curl and get crispy in the oven.

    Spread the garlic butter on the pizza crust.
