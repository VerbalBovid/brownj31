![](oatmeal_chocolate_chip_cookie/cookie.jpeg){width="300"}

### Ingredients

-   $\frac{1}{2}$ lb unsalted butter (2 sticks)
-   $\frac{3}{4}$ cup + 1 tbsp white sugar
-   $\frac{3}{4}$ cup light brown sugar
-   $2$ eggs
-   $1\frac{1}{4}$ tsp vanilla extract
-   $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp lemon juice
-   $2\frac{1}{4}$ cup flour
-   $\frac{1}{2}$ cup rolled oats (or use flour if you don't have oats)
-   $1$ tsp baking soda
-   $1$ tsp salt
-   $1$ pinch cinnamon
-   $2\frac{2}{3}$ cups Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate chips
-   $1\frac{3}{4}$ cups chopped walnuts

**Note**: I normally skimp on the chocolate chips and walnuts

### Directions

1.  Cream $\frac{1}{2}$ lb unsalted butter (2 sticks), $\frac{3}{4}$ cup + 1 tbsp white sugar, and $\frac{3}{4}$ cup light brown sugar until thoroughly combined. If you don't have an electric mixer, it's easiest to do this by cutting the butter into small cubes and using a wooden spoon to work it into the sugar.
2.  Add $2$ eggs, $1\frac{1}{4}$ tsp vanilla extract, and $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp lemon juice and mix until light and fluffy.
3.  Add $2\frac{1}{4}$ cup flour, $\frac{1}{2}$ cup rolled oats, $1$ tsp baking soda, $1$ tsp salt, and $1$ pinch cinnamon and stir to combine.
4.  Stir in $2\frac{2}{3}$ cups Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate chips and $1\frac{3}{4}$ cups chopped walnuts.
